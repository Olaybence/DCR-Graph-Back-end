# DCR-Graph-Back-end
A Java spring boot (Spring Framework) server for backend

## Editor

Eclipse is our choice of editor for the backend. It therefore has to be downloaded for managing the backend (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

## Initialize DataBase

Open the backend code folder in the chosen IDE as a project. 

Then run the code by rightclicking on RestfulGraphBackendApplication.java -> Run as -> Java application.
(Can be found at DCR-Graph-Back-end\restful-web-services\src\main\java\com\DCR\rest\webservices\restfulwebservices in the file explorer)

The backend will then;

Start on http://localhost:8080/local for the local graphs
Start on http://localhost:8080/shared for the shared graphs


## Communicating with the frontend

The DataBase will be able to communicate with the frontend once the server has been opened. Updates and additions made in the frontend will be properly added to the backend.
